# FallenAngel
This is a simple game I made for my 1st year 1st semester in University for Introduction to Programming.

The game was programmed in ruby. The main goal of the player is to kill the golems. There are three types of golems that players can select from.

The player can move using the arrow keys and attack using the space bar. A screenshot of lava golem type is shown below.

After loosing 3 lives, the player will be directed to the end menu.

The player can choose whether they want to play again, go back to main menu or quit the game.
